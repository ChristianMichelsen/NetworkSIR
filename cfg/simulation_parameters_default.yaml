# Other:

day_max: 35 # 5 weeks. Sets the maximum number of days the algorithm runs
clustering_connection_retries: 0 # number of times to try and reconnect two agents
work_other_ratio: 0.5 # 0.2 = 20% work, 80% other
N_contacts_max: 100 # maximum number of contacts

# event-related variables
N_events: 0 # number of daily events
event_size_max: 50 #max size of events. If 0 => N_tot (no max)

event_beta_scaling: 5 # how much more disease spreads at events (1 = normal, 2 = double of normal)
event_weekend_multiplier: 2.0 # ratio of how many more events are happening in weekends. 1 = similar, 2 = double


# Lockdown-related variables

do_interventions: False # bool, whether or not to apply any interventions, lockdowns or similar

# 1: Lockdown (jobs and schools)
# 2: Cover (with face masks)
# 3: Tracking (infected and their connections)
# 4: Test people with symptoms
# 5: Isolate
# 6: Random Testing
# 0: Do nothing

days_looking_back: 7 # When looking for local outbreaks, how many days are we looking back, e.g. number of people infected within the last 7 days

# Reductions.
# The rate reductions are list of list, first and second entry are rate reductions for the groups [family, job, other]. The third entry is the chance of choosing the first set. As such you can have some follow the lockdown and some not or some one group being able to work from home and another isn't.
